# Education App 

## Introduction
We started the planning of the project when we ourselves experienced the problems and also the problems faced by the students of our college because students had to visit different websites in search of learning materials like previous year question papers, syllabus, exam timetable etc. This process of visiting different websites is time consuming and there is wastage of the precious time of students. Therefore we decided to develop an application that will serve as a one stop destination for all the student’s study needs.

## Objective
Our objective is to create a mobile application app that provides educational services to students through their mobile devices, using the Android OS platform. While using this application students can take the advantage of various facilities in a single app like students can see their syllabus, notes, discuss their doubts, get previous year question papers as well as attempt quiz to improve their knowledge.
Along with this there will be a facility to upload notes to help other students.
